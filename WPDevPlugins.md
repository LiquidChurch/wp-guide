# WordPress Plugins
- [Query Monitor](https://querymonitor.com/) is an excellent (and free) plugin for seeing exactly how your WordPress code is working and can be very helpful in debugging.
- [What the File?](https://www.barrykooij.com/what-the-file/) is a useful extension that lets you see exactly which template files are being used to compose the page you are currently viewing.
- Plugins are available for accessing the database but we recommend using the bundled phpMyAdmin, keeps the WP install slimmer.
