## Plugins
We use a number of plugins on our site. Some of these have been developed in-house (and are available free in our repositories). Some come from the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins), some we have bought directly from vendors/developers, and some have been purchased through [CodeCanyon](https://codecanyon.net/).

Whenever we are looking to add new functionality to the site it is important for us to ask:
1. Are any pre-built solutions we can customize for our site available?
2. If a pre-built solution is available, do we trust that it has reliable and long-term support?
3. How will adding this plugin to our WP install affect performance, usability, and security?
