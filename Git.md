# Version Control Using Git

You should be using [GitHub](https://github.com/) for your code repositories and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as your client/local repository host. Feel free to utilize a GUI based interface on top of the git software if you prefer (most IDE's have some support built-in).


### Create/Clone Repositories
- If you are starting a new project from scratch you'll want to create a repo on GitHub and clone that repo down to your local machine.
- If you are working on an existing repo you'll clone it to your local machine.
- You should clone into: vvv/www/wordpress-one/public_html/wp-content/{plugins-or-themes}
    - By default the github repo name will be used as the folder name.
