[1] Much of the material here will apply to WordPress.com as well as the free/open WordPress, but we will not take the time to distinguish when certain features are not available on WordPress.com that are part of the free/open WordPress, nor will we cover functionality that is available via WordPress.com but not via the free/open WordPress. To learn more about the differences between WordPress.com and WordPress.org see [this WPMUdev article](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/wordpress-com-and-wordpress-org/).
