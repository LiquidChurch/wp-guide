# Terminal
We recommend using a terminal application. These are packaged with MacOS and Linux but not with Windows. Git for Windows does bundle a BASH environment with it and we recommend using this on Windows.

NOTE: If you are going to use `vagrant up` (see below) you'll need to start Git BASH as an administrator.

## Other Notes
- If using Windows and Git Bash it is helpful to add a few aliases to Git Bash. These are the same as those found in [More on VVV](MoreOnVVV.md) but with the path updated from `/srv/` to `/c/path/to/vvv/`.
