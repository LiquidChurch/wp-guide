# Liquid Church's WordPress Guide

## Introduction
This repository provides an opinioniated guide to the use of WordPress at Liquid Church.

## Development

### Local Environment
There are many ways to setup a development environment for WordPress. In our experience one of the simplest and most mature is [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/) which uses [VirtualBox](https://virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com).

For more on why we recommend VVV see More On Local Environments.
