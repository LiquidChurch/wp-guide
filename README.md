# WordPress Itself
WordPress is a Content Management System (CMS) written in HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. It is available for free and under an open source license from [WordPress.org](wordpress.org). It is the world's most widely used CMS and is utilized by well over 25% of the world's websites that utilize a CMS - from small blogs to the largest enterprises.

Matt Mullenweg is the de facto leader of WordPress, having started the [project in 2003 with Mike Little.](wordpress.org/about/) Matt is also CEO of Automattic which offers a number of WordPress products and services including [WordPress.com](wordpress.com), a hosted WordPress service. For the purposes of this article we will be focusing on the free and open source version of WordPress as opposed to that provided by Automattic at WordPress.com.<sup>1</sup>

# Why WordPress?
Why have we chosen to use WordPress instead of creating a bespoke CMS or utilizing any of the many other CMS options available?

1. It is the market leader for content management systems and as such has a tremendous ecosystem built around it including thousands of businesses that specialize in building bespoke solutions on top of WordPress.
1. It is open source, this means that we can view and change the source code as needed. Should WordPress be abandoned (not gonna happen) or should it go in a direction at odds with our needs we can always choose to *fork* the code and create our own implementation that is tailored to our needs (we have no intention of doing so).
1. It is extendable using themes and plugins - whether custom-built or from a third party. Many of these themes/plugins are also open source.
1. It provides a User Interface which is friendly to non-technical users but also has tremendous power under the hood that can be utilized by developers.

# Themes
WordPress uses themes to customize the appearance of a WordPress instance. There are tens of thousands of themes available, some [free](wordpress.org/themes), some for [pay](themeforest.net). One can also build custom themes, but more on that later.

# Plugins
WordPress uses plugins to extend the default functionality of the CMS. There are tens of thousands of plugins available, many [free](wordpress.org/plugins/) and [paid](codecanyon.net).

# Concepts
There are lots of terms and concepts you'll want to become familiar with - posts, pages, permalinks, page errors, and so on.

# Resources for Learning
As one would expect of such a popular system, there are numerous books, articles, videos, and courses available to learn about WordPress. We will highlight just a few.

## Official Documentation
Unfortunately, the state of documentation for the user is less than ideal. For many years documentation for both regular users and developers was kept in the [Codex](codex.wordpress.org), a wiki with some great content but somewhat loosely organized and without a clear path for learning WordPress. Since then the documentation for developers has been largely rewritten into helpful handbooks and references listed below. You can use the Codex to learn the regular use of WordPress, but I'd recommend looking elsewhere.
- [The Official WordPress.org Theme Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/) - For developers.
- [The Official WordPress.org Plugin Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/) - For developers.
- [The Official WordPress.org Code Reference](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/) - For developers.
- [The Official WordPress.org REST API Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) - For developers.

## Books
You could start with a book on WordPress, but honestly, this is a little overwhelming. I'd recommend setting up a test WordPress install, playing around with it, and reading some articles on WordPress. Once you have the lay of the land a book length treatment will be significantly more helpful.
- [WordPress Complete - 6th Edition by Karol Krol](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/wordpress-complete-/9781787285705/) - 8/2017 - Covers regular usage (creating pages, posts, etc.), using plugins, theme development, social media integration, creating plugins, using the REST API, and so on. The first half of this book will be helpful to the regular user, the second half to developers in particular.

## Articles
There are several sites that publish top quality articles on WordPress on a regular basis. These include:
- [Sitepoint](sitepoint.com)
- [Torque](torquemag.io)

## Videos

## Courses
- [WPMUdev's The Academy](https://premium.wpmudev.org/academy/) - A full set of courses covering development, multisite, javascript, etc. Focused on the developer, not the regular user.

1. Much of the material here will apply to WordPress.com as well as the free/open WordPress, but we will not take the time to distinguish when certain features are not available on WordPress.com that are part of the free/open WordPress, nor will we cover functionality that is available via WordPress.com but not via the free/open WordPress. To learn more about the differences between WordPress.com and WordPress.org see [this WPMUdev article](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/wordpress-com-and-wordpress-org/).
